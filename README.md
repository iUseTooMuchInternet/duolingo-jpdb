# Gamify JPDB with Duolingo!
Making studying vocab with JPDB a bit more fun by pretty much turning it into Duolingo ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Current features
- Add a feedback (e.g. "Good job!") paired with a jingle after each answer.

## Planned features
*Italics* indicate that I'm working on it.
- *Progress bar*
- *"Complete!" message paired with audio after each study session.*
- Animation.
- "Streak continued" animation after first done session of each day.

## Credits
Inspired by, and answer feedback code taken from [Duolingo-style gamification -- visual, audio, and haptic feedback!](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/255048658)
